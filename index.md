# Anusree Saha

Postdoctoral Research Associate  
Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge

## Research
I study plant–microbe interactions, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, and sustainable agriculture, with a focus on nutrient use efficiency and crop improvement.

## Teaching & Mentorship
I have taught and mentored undergraduate and postgraduate students in India and at the University of Cambridge.
